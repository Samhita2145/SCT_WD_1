# 🌌 AURORA — Cinematic UI Experience

Aurora is a modern, emotion-driven user interface inspired by the *idea* of streaming platforms.
Instead of focusing on loud visuals, the project emphasizes calm design, smooth interactions,
and thoughtful spacing to create a refreshing user experience.

This project was developed to demonstrate frontend fundamentals along with UI/UX thinking and interaction design.
